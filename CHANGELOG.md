## [Unreleased]

## [v0.2.0] - 2022-10-29
### Changed
- Add more open version constraints to let install Raven in more projects.
  As a library, being too strict with dependencies is always bad.

### Added
- Introduces a new object in the `CHStudio\Raven\Http\Factory` namespace named:
  `RequestUriParametersResolver`. It allows resolving URI parameters value using
  a `ValueResolverInterface` object.
